Gray images are a mosaic of video images of surface vasculature visualized through a cranial window. Green images are maximal intensity z-projections of in vivo two photon volumes (6 in total). All images are linked, clicking on one will bring up the full image volume. \n\n\n\n\nExample 2.\n The gray images are an automatically created mosaic of surface vasculature images from a video camera looking down into a cranial window. The green squares are the position of image stacks acquired with a scanning microscope. The Canvas software seamlessly integrates with \nMap Manager\n providing point and click navigation, browsing, and annotations of all image stacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.\n This is an example of a Canvas acquired during two-photon imaging and electrophysiology in a cerebellar slice. The first image is an overview of the canvas and the second is a zoomed in view of the recording and imaging areas.\n\n\nHardware and Software Requirements\n\n\n\n\nWindows 7 or Windows XP\n\n\nWavemetrics Igor Pro 6 or 7, \nlink\n\n\nMotor controllers (to get/set the position of the objective\n\n\nSutter Instruments mp285, \nlink\n\n\nBruker Prairie view software \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScanning microscope software (to import images)\n\n\nScanImage, \nlink\n\n\nPrairie View\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo acquisition\n\n\nAny USB video camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanvas Panel\n\n\nX/Y/Z\n.

This does not move the onjective but is useful to be able to read absolute distances moved.\n\n\nArrow Buttons\n. Move the motor the specified distance. All units are in um. The four arrows in the left pane move within the image plane (left, right, front, back). The two arrows in the right plane move in depth/z (up and down).\n\n\nX, Y, and Z Step (um)\n.

This is the x/y voxel size (um) of a stack taken at 1x magnification and 1024 \u2018pixels per line\u2019, 1024 \u2018lines per frame\u2019. This value is used to linearly scale all other stack imports to arbitrary magnification and \u2018lines per frame\u2019/\u2019pixels per line\u2019.\n\n\n\n\nAcquiring video\n\n\nIf the video camera on your scope has an analog signal, there are very inexpensive video to usb converters. We regularly use EasyCap DC60 converters ($10-$20). Converters like this take an analog video signal, convert it to USB and then single frames or video is captured within Igor Pro using their free driver.\n\n\nHigh end USB2/3 cameras will generally work but the size of the frame acquired by Igor may be smaller than the sensor. To circumvent this, we have a video viewer/capture script written in Matlab that saves full FOV images from a usb camera that is then automatically loaded into Igor.\n\n\nControlling the objective\n\n\nThe position of the objective is read and the objective can be moved from within the canvas.\n\n\nSutter mp285\n\n\nBoth ScanImage and Igor need to read the position and move the motorized objective. This is done by communicating with one physical serial-port, a COM port. Microsoft Windows only allows one program to communicate with each physical serial-port but we need both Matlab and Igor to communicate with the same COM port. Thus, we use third-party software to split the physical COM port into two virtual ports, one for Matlab and one for Igor.\n\n\nThere are a few different programs to create virtual COM ports from one physical COM port.\n\n\n\n\nWindows 7: Serial Splitter 5.0 (Eltima Software), $100.

FREE\n\n\n\n\nPrairie View\n\n\nThe Canvas software communicates with Prairie View over a TCP/IP (localhost) connection using Igor's SOCKIT library.\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nCanvas is designed to work on any scope that has a computer controlled objective or stage. It has been tested using x/y/z objective motors using a Sutter mp285 controller and a Bruker Scope using Prairie View software.\n\n\nmp285 motor controller\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nSerial Splitter 5\n\n\nMake 2 virtual serial ports from the COM port the mp285 is plugged into\n\n\nRewrite ScanImage startup script to use one of the virtual COM ports\n\n\nMake sure Igor is using the other virtual COM port\n\n\n\n\nBruker motor controller\n\n\nFor Bruker Prairie View, we need the Igor SOCKIT extension.\n    - Download \nSOCKIT\n\n    - Uncompress and install SOCKIT XOP into Igor Pro 6\n    - Once this is done, motor position will be read and motor will be moved using a localhost TCP/IP protocol\n\n\nRunning canvas\n\n\n\n\nOpen Igor 6\n\n\nOpen PrairieCanvas.ipf\n\n\nCompile procedures by clicking on the Igor command window\n\n\n\n\nSelect menu 'Canvas - Load User' and select a user .txt file. This will open the main canvas panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new canvas by entering a 'session ID' and pressing 'Initialize Session'. This will open a new canvas window with motor controls.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow a preview of the USB video camera with the 'Preview' button.\n\n\n\n\nThe red square in the canvas shows the current motor position.\n\n\nMove the motor with arrow buttons. The red square should update its positon. IF it does not, try the movement again.\n\n\n\n\nCapture video with 'Capture Video' and the video will be placed in the current position within the canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScan some images in either Scan Image or Prairie View and then hit 'Import From Scope' to import these images into the canvas. The images will appear as squares in the canvas. Selecting a square will highlight the stack in the Stack Browser and the stack can be opened directly into Igor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe canvas is automatically saved as new video and scope images are created and imported.\n\n\nOff line analysis\n\n\n\n\nRun Map Manager and open the Stack Browser\n\n\nSelect 'Load Canvas' and load your canvas.
