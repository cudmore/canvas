The green squares are the position of image stacks acquired with a scanning microscope. The Canvas software seamlessly integrates with \nMap Manager\n providing point and click navigation, browsing, and annotations of all image stacks.\n\n\nExample 2: Ex vivo canvas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a Canvas acquired during two-photon imaging and electrophysiology in a cerebellar slice. The first image is an overview of the canvas and the second is a zoomed in view of the recording and imaging areas.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Canvas that visually places each video image and scanned images into a unified \u2018motor space\u2019.\n\n\nPrevious canvases can be loaded and displayed using the Map Manager Stack Browser.\n\n\nQuickly and easily acquire the same fields-of-view both within and between time-points spanning minutes, hours, days and months.\n\n\n\n\nThis is designed to work on any scope that has a computer controlled objective or stage. It has been tested using x/y/z objective motors using a Sutter mp285 controller and a Bruker Scope using Prairie View software.\n\n\nHardware and Software Requirements\n\n\n\n\nWindows 7 or Windows XP\n\n\nWavemetrics Igor Pro 6 or 7, \nlink\n\n\nMotor controllers (to get/set the position of the objective\n\n\nSutter Instruments mp285, \nlink\n\n\nBruker Prairie view software \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScanning microscope software (to import images)\n\n\nScanImage, \nlink\n\n\nPrairie View\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo acquisition\n\n\nAny USB video camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n\n\nX/Y/Z\n. Gives the current position of the motor.\n\n\nRead Position\n. Reads the current motor position.\n\n\nZero X/Y\n and \nZero Z\n. Zero the current position in the Canvas software. This does not move the onjective but is useful to be able to read absolute distances moved.\n\n\nArrow Buttons\n. Move the motor the specified distance. All units are in um. The four arrows in the left pane move within the image plane (left, right, front, back). The two arrows in the right plane move in depth/z (up and down).\n\n\nX, Y, and Z Step (um)\n. Set the distance (in um) taken when each of the arrow buttons are used to move the motor.\n\n\nSet Path\n. Set the save path of the current canvas. This can automatically be set in a scripted user file.\n\n\nInitialize Session\n. Initialize a new session with specified \u2018Session ID\u2019. Each new session will have its own canvas and save folder.\n\n\nHDD\n. Show the hard-disk-drive folder for the current session.\n\n\nDisplay Canvas\n. Display the current canvas. The current canvas is created when a session is initialized with \u2018Initialize Session\u2019.\n\n\nFinalize and clear canvas\n. Used at the end of an imaging session to close the current canvas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions Panel\n\n\nVideo Group.\n\n\nSpecifies the size of a video image in both pixels and um.\n\n\nRefresh 2P Squares Group.\n\n\nDisplay This Channel\n. The default color channel to display in the canvas.\n\n\nAuto Save Canvas and Notebook\n.

Name of the objective. Usually 20x, 40x, 5x, etc.\n\n\nWidth. Width of field of view of objective (um)\n\n\nHeight. Height of field of view of objective (um)\n\n\nStepx and Stepy. Distance the motor will move when a movement arrow button is pressed. These values also appear in the canvas motor bar.\n\n\nvoxelsize. For importing .tif files. This is the x/y voxel size (um) of a stack taken at 1x magnification and 1024 \u2018pixels per line\u2019, 1024 \u2018lines per frame\u2019. This value is used to linearly scale all other stack imports to arbitrary magnification and \u2018lines per frame\u2019/\u2019pixels per line\u2019.\n\n\n\n\nAcquiring video\n\n\nIf the video camera on your scope has an analog signal, there are very inexpensive video to usb converters. We regularly use EasyCap DC60 converters ($10-$20). Converters like this take an analog video signal, convert it to USB and then single frames or video is captured within Igor Pro using their free driver.\n\n\nHigh end USB2/3 cameras will generally work but the size of the frame acquired by Igor may be smaller than the sensor. To circumvent this, we have a video viewer/capture script written in Matlab that saves full FOV images from a usb camera that is then automatically loaded into Igor.\n\n\nControlling the objective\n\n\nThe position of the objective is read and the objective can be moved from within the canvas.\n\n\nSutter mp285\n\n\nBoth ScanImage and Igor need to read the position and move the motorized objective. This is done by communicating with one physical serial-port, a COM port. Microsoft Windows only allows one program to communicate with each physical serial-port but we need both Matlab and Igor to communicate with the same COM port. Thus, we use third-party software to split the physical COM port into two virtual ports, one for Matlab and one for Igor.\n\n\nThere are a few different programs to create virtual COM ports from one physical COM port.\n\n\n\n\nWindows 7: Serial Splitter 5.0 (Eltima Software), $100.

FREE\n\n\n\n\nPrairie View\n\n\nThe Canvas software communicates with Prairie View over a TCP/IP (localhost) connection using Igor's SOCKIT library.\n\n\nKnown Bugs\n\n\n\n\nIf you enter a space in your scanimage file name, your mp285 canvas will not work properly. If you realize this after you have already created a canvas with \u2018Import Scanimage\u2019, manually change the space in each scan image .tif file (on the hard-drive) to an underscore (_). Do NOT simply delete the space, you must change it to an underscore.\n\n\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nRobert Cudmore's homepage\n\n\nMap Manager",
