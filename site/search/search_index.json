            "text": "Canvas is software to acquire and visualize spatially organized video and image volumes in 'objective' space.\n\n\nThis is most useful when performing repeated imaging through a cranial window as it allows disjoint images to be acquired repeatedly across timescale of minutes, days, and months.\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Canvas that visually places each video image and ScanImage .tif file into a unified \u2018motor space\u2019.\n\n\nCapture single frame video images from any USB camera\n\n\nImport .tif images acquired with either ScanImage or Prairie View\n\n\nPrevious canvases can be loaded and displayed using the Stack Browser.\n\n\nQuickly and easily acquire the same fields-of-view both within and between time-points spanning minutes, hours, days and months.\n\n\n\n\nThis is designed to work on any scope that has a computer controlled objective or an x/y stage. It has been tested using x/y/z objective motors using a Sutter mp285 controller and a Bruker Scope using PRairie View software.\n\n\nHardware Requirements\n\n\n\n\nWindows 7 or Windows XP\n\n\nIgor Pro 6 or 7\n\n\nSutter Instruments mp285 motor controller (web page)\n\n\nPrairie view\n\n\nScanImage 3.6 \u2013 3.8 (web page)\n\n\nAny USB video camera\n\n\n\n\nThird-party software to create virtual serial ports to share the mp285 motor controller.\nVideo to usb. This can be very cheap, we use EasyCap DC60 found here ($10-$20). Converters like this take an analog video signal, convert it to USB and then single frames or video is captured within Igor Pro using their free driver.\n\n\nVirtual Serial Ports. Both ScanImage and Igor need to read the position and move the motorized objective (usually a Sutter mp285). This is done by communicating with one physical serial-port , a COM port. Microsoft Windows only allows one program to communicate with each physical serial-port but we need both Matlab and Igor to communicate with the same COM port. Third-party software must be used to split the physical COM port into two virtual ports, one for Matlab and one for Igor. There are a few different programs to create multiple COM ports from one physical COM port.\n\n\nWindows 7: Serial Splitter 5.0 (Eltima Software), $100.

All units are in um. The four arrows in the left pane move within the image plane (left, right, front, back). The two arrows in the right plane move in depth/z (up and down).\n\n\nVideo Group\n\n\nPreview. Open the video preview window\n\n\nCapture Image. Capture a single frame from the video preview window. The image will be placed in the mp285 canvas using the current motor position.\n\n\nCanvas Group\n\n\nDisplay Canvas. Display the current mp285 canvas. The current canvas is created when a session is initialized with \u2018Initialize Session\u2019.\n\n\nUser Save Group\n\n\nLoad. Load a user file. User files are .txt files that define the default behavior of mp285 canvas.\n\n\nInitialize Session. Initialize a new session with name specified in \u2018Session ID\u2019. Each new session will have its own canvas and hard-drive folder.\n\n\nHDD. Show the hard-disk-drive folder for the current session.\n\n\nOptions. Open mp285 Options panel.\n\n\nStack Browser.

If the wrong port is specified, it can be changed by entering the correct COM port in the \u2018Serial Port\u2019 text field.\n\n\nVideo Group.\n\n\nSpecifies the size of a video image in both pixels and um.\n\n\nRefresh 2P Squares Group.\n\n\nDisplay This Channel. The default channel (1 or 2) that will be displayed in the mp285 canvas.\n\n\nAuto Save Canvas and Notebook. The canvas and notebook will be saved each time \u2018Import ScanImage\u2019 button is pressed.\n\n\nStack Group.\n\n\nStack Window Size. Specifies the default size of stack windows. It is useful to match this size to the default size of each channel window in ScanImage.\n\n\nObjective Group.\n\n\nEach row is a different objective with:\n\n\nName. Name of the objective. Usually 20x, 40x, 5x, etc.\n\n\nWidth. Width of field of view of objective (um)\n\n\nHeight. Height of field of view of objective (um)\n\n\nStepx and Stepy. Distance the mp285 motor will move when a movement arrow button is pressed. These values also appear in the mp285 canvas motor bar.\n\n\nvoxelsize. For importing ScanImage .tif files. This is the x/y voxel size (um) of a ScanImage stack taken at 1x magnification and 1024 \u2018pixels per line\u2019, 1024 \u2018lines per frame\u2019. This value is used to linearly scale all other ScanImage imports to arbitrary magnification and \u2018lines per frame\u2019/\u2019pixels per line\u2019.\n\n\nKnown Problems\n-If you enter a space in your scanimage file name, your mp285 canvas will not work properly. If you realize this after you have already created a canvas with \u2018Import Scanimage\u2019, manually change the space in each scan image .tif file (on the hard-drive) to an underscore (_). Do NOT simply delete the space, you must change it to an underscore.",
